    "In this notebook, I aim to demonstrate how RSA encryption can be broken through Shor's algorithm. I will first include a successful transfer of encrypted data using the RSA protocol. Next, I will simulate an eavesdropper who intercepts the encrypted message and uses a classical algorithm to decrypt it. Finally, I will simulate another eavesdropper who instead uses the quantum Shor's algorithm to decrypt the message. Through this process, I will show that Shor's algorithm offers a time complexity speed up to the alternative classical algorithm for cracking RSA encryption."

    "As demonstrated above, the classical eavesdropper will have a greater time complexity than the quantum eavesdropper (who uses Shor's algorithm). This means that numbers which were previously too big to be realistically factored by classical algorithms will not hold up against Shor's algorithm. This not only demonstrates the power of quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm, but also the risk that they pose to current cybersecurity systems. Even though current quantum computers are not powerful enough to use Shor's algorithm on meaningfully large inputs, this will definitely change in the coming years. Therefore, efforts to update encryption to be quantum proof are not only necessary but urgent."
